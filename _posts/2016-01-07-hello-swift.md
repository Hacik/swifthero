Building a better mobile experience using Swift.

I've been an app producer since 2004 --solving problems for music, journalism, education and social impact-- and I'm excited to start my journey through Swift. For anyone familiar with Java or Actionscript 3 (and even Javascript) Swift will feel familiar. Swift reaps all the benefits of a compiled language (speed, error checking, type checking) yet still preserves the aspects of a fun scripting language. The following posts aim to explore the various ways you can build apps using Swift, NodeJS, 3rd party API's, private SDK's and open source code. 

I've also created a Github repo for people interested in trying out the various demos I've created.  https://github.com/swifthero

Swift on!
