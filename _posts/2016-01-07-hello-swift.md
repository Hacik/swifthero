Building a better mobile experience using Swift.

I've been an app producer since 2004 --solving problems for music, journalism, education and social impact-- and I'm excited to start my journey through Swift. For anyone familiar with Java or Actionscript 3 (and even Javascript) Swift will feel familiar. Swift reaps all the benefits of a compiled language (speed, error checking, type checking) yet still preserves the aspects of a fun scripting language. The following posts aim to explore the various ways you can build apps using Swift, NodeJS, 3rd party API's, private SDK's and open source code. 

Swift on!
